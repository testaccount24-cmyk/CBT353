+
+SMB provides a low-overhead, quick-response, browse of data in main memory.
+
+Commands are: %H+ for vertical hex on/off   %N+ for "find next" search mode
+              %C+ for columns line on/off   %P+ for "find previous" search mode
+
+A "find" character string can be specified%only+on line 3 of the display, in
+the field provided,%not+on the command line. The field must be enclosed in
+single quotes if the string you are trying to find has leading or trailing
+quotes or blanks. Imbedded blanks or quotes do not require the string to be in
+quotes. The format of the find string can be specified in the%FMT+field as:
+
+               C -character, match regardless of upper/lower case.
+               T -text, match exactly as entered
+               H -hex, match the hex representation exactly as entered
+
+The columnar range of the find can be restricted by updating the%COL+fields.
+
+Vertical and horizontal scroll amounts are entered on the right of line 2.
