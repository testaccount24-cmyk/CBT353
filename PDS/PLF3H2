  %C+- COPY    (use "NEWNAME/AC" column). %S+- SELECT (same as EDIT)
  %D+- DISABLE                          %COM+- Add/Update comment line
  %E+- EDIT                              %AA+- Add Access code (in "NEWNAME/AC")
  %K+- KILL    (restricted)              %AC+- Change AC (enter "old,new")
  %P+- PRINT                             %AD+- Delete AC (enter old AC)
  %X+- Select for transfer

  The command line can be used to enter :
  %COMM/NOCOMM+ Display/don't display comment lines
  %XFER+   Generate transfer JCL (ARCH/NOARCH to have archive jcl, also)
  %C0000+  where 0000 is the control word. (All 4 digits must be specified.)
  %PSPOOL+ to identify a library in PANSPOOL format.
  %nnnn+   where "nnnn" is the scroll amount. This is used with PF7 and PF8.
  %L mem+  where "mem" is the leading characters of the member you want
           to locate in the directory display.

 %NOTE:+ If a library member is access-controlled, you must enter the 4-digit
         access code in the "NEWNAME/AC" column.
